1- Providing an autocomplete service to return a list of top-10 documents based on
their titles. The system should start suggesting titles after the 3rd
typed character. Take into consideration that the user might write some misspelled words

GET reuters/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "elastic"
    }
  }
}


3- Return the top-10 mentioned geo-references across the entire index:

GET /reuters_index/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "top_geo_references": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "geo_references"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "geo_reference_terms": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "geo_references.reference",
            "size": 10
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
